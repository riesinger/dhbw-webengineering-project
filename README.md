# Webengineering Project

This is a web calendar using really outdated technologies to satisfy the needs for the Webengineering course.

## Installing

Clone this repo, then either run `npm install` or `yarn`, depending on which package manager you
prefer (you prefer `yarn`!).

## Building

For developer's convenience, there are some tasks setup, which will help you develop and build the
app.

First, there is `npm run dev`, which will start `nodemon` on the server.


Also, for some reason, XSLT does not seem to work in Firefox Quantum, so alternatively use Google
Chrome, Internet Explorer 6 or Netscape Navigator 4.0. You might also use Opera Presto, which has
the fastest SVG renderer ever! (Even faster than Chrome and Firefox combined!!!!!)
